- StandardScaler is calculated by subtracting each value from it's respective column's mean and divide it by the respective column's standard deviation

- StandardScaler is vulnerable to outliers because it affects the mean of the column

- Quantile Transformer is used to scale properly and remove the outliers from your data

- Logistic Regression is used to classify the data into 2 classes

- Machine learning model doesn't take alphabetical data, it takes numerical data, so to convert alphabetical data into numerical data, we can use one hot encoding
